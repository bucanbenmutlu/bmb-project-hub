Project Overview

Welcome to Project Forge, my central hub for designing and developing quantum-focused projects.  
This repo tracks my ideas, experiments, simulations, and long-term goals across quantum computing, physics, and engineering.

Mission
Build a consistent, evolving portfolio of quantum work — code, simulations, diagrams, and research notes — while developing real engineering habits.

Core Areas of Focus

1. Quantum Information & Computation  
Working through the foundations of qubits, gates, circuits, and algorithms.  
Topics I explore here include:
- Bloch sphere intuition  
- CNOT behavior in monolithic vs distributed processors  
- Error rates and noise modeling  
- Bell states and entanglement maps  

 2. Quantum Error Correction (QEC)  
Designing small-scale simulations of:
- Shor code  
- Surface code basics  
- Logical vs physical qubits  
- Fidelity drift over repeated operations  
Goal: understand how real quantum machines stay alive long enough to compute.

3. Distributed Quantum Systems  
This is where quantum engineering feels like sci-fi.  
Key experiments I track:
- Remote CNOT vs on-chip CNOT efficiency  
- Bell-pair generation fidelity  
- Communication latency in quantum networks  
- Tiny models of repeaters and teleportation  

 4. Quantum Machine Learning (QML)  
Early work includes:
- Variational circuits  
- Quantum data encoding  
- Tiny classification tasks  
- Hybrid classical/quantum training loops  


 Current Experiments
A living list of what I’m actively working on:
- Mapping gate fidelity differences between CZ vs CX  
- Creating visual heatmaps of noise landscapes  
- Short simulations of decoherence over time  
- New “Self-Regenerating Mars Shield” revisions
